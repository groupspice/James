        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTWelcome to the Deepening Life Together study on James. For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want you to know that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you prayerfully respond to the principles you learn in this study, God will move you to a deeper level of com- mitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.Psalm 100:5Session OutlineMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overempha- size one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship.5]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstRarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, minis- try, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a Memory Verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities.You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker question, and/or you can check in with one or two group members— your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encourage- ment in your spiritual journey.DVD Teaching SegmentA Deepening Life Together: James Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Tim Theule. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discus- sion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section).GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passagesyou’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. 6]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstThe focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders con- nect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.7]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstStudy NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (optional)Some sessions provide For Deeper Study. If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more bib- lical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group. You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.8]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONWisdom is the understanding that enables a person to face trials, an attitude that determines how we live. Filled with practical wisdom and written in to-the-point proverbial style, James has been often called the “Proverbs” of the New Testament.It was written by James, the brother of Jesus. James had been an opponent of Jesus during his earthly ministry. Having lived and walked with Jesus in the  esh after the resurrection, James joined the body of believers going from adversary to apostle and leader of the Jerusalem church.James is writing to Jewish Christians who had been scattered as a result of persecution and oppression. They believe themselves to be spiritually mature and demonstrate it through their discriminat- ing behavior and bitter words and attitudes. They vied for positions of authority, both in the church and socially. These attitudes were damaging their fellowship.The book of James encourages the reader to evaluate his or her own behavior against a mirror of righteousness and truth and make adjustments in areas where we fall short. James lays it all on the line in a practical and hard-hitting way, addressing the issues of persevering under trials, favoritism, controlling our tongues,  ghting and quarrelling, and living with one another in humility—all issues still plaguing the church today and, that when taken to heart, can transform how we live our lives as the body of Christ.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONEOVERVIEW: FAITH THAT WORKSMEMORY VERSE: For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead (James 2:26 NASB).Someone once said to Mother Teresa, “I wouldn’t do what you’re doing for a million dollars!” Mother Teresa replied, “Neither would I.” Mother Teresa left her home at age eighteen to answer God’s call to serve as a missionary. After receiving her training in Ireland, she began teaching at a high school in the slums of India. The su ering and poverty outside the windows of the school compelled her to do something more. The Missionaries of Charity was established in 1950 as a result of this compulsion. Its primary mission is to care for the poorest of the poor: the starving, homeless, crippled, blind, and dying—the outcasts of society no one else would help. Today, through Mother Teresa’s living example of faith in action, the orga- nization of brothers and sisters has grown to serve every continentand almost every country of the world.John Calvin once said, “We are justi ed by faith alone, but the faiththat justi es is never alone.” Faith is not just a feeling or sentiment. It must have substance. If it lacks substance, it’s unconvincing to the world around us. Saving faith compels us to demonstrate it through11]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[DEEPENINGour day-to-day choices. Mother Teresa exempli ed this through her life of compassion and serving the unlovable of the world.This  rst session of our study of the book of James will introduce us to the type of faith that compels us to demonstrate it through the way we live our lives.CONNECTING 10 min.Begin your group time with prayer. Ask God for willing hearts to receive his Word through this Bible study and for the courage to change as he challenges you in the weeks to come.Deeper relationships happen when we take time to keep in touch with one another. As you begin, pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. When the roster gets to you, write down your contact information, including the best time and method for contacting you. Then, someone volunteer to make cop- ies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, what you do for fun, and any- thing else you would like to share.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your group values. In the Appendix is a Small Group Agreement with values most useful in sustain- ing healthy, balanced groups. Review these values and choose one or two—values you haven’t previously focused on or have roomtogrowin—toemphasizeduringthisstudy.Choosethose that will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health. Discuss how you will implement these values in your small group.3. Share a time when you saw someone’s faith compel them to serve others.12]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[GROWING45–50 min.Overview: Faith That WorksJames is possibly the oldest of the New Testament writings, dating around AD 45–50. It is sometimes referred to as the “Proverbs” of the New Testament because of its direct and strong exhortations to wise living. With emphasis on how our actions demonstrate our faith in Christ, James provides the believer with practical guidance on how to live a life pleasing to God.4. James was Jesus’s brother (Matt.13:55). What impression do you get from Mark 3:20–21 and John 7:1–5 about the way Jesus’s brothers viewed him during his earthly ministry?5. What happened to change James’s view of Jesus (1 Cor. 15:3–7)?6. James became one of the leaders of the church in Jerusalem, as respected as the apostles (Acts 15:12–21; Gal. 2:9). Read James 1:1. Why do you suppose James introduced himself like this, and not as “James, the brother of Jesus Christ” or “James, leader of the church in Jerusalem”?Read James 1:19–27.7. How is a person who hears God’s Word but doesn’t live by it like a person who sees his own re ection but then forgets what he looks like (vv. 23–24)?8. Have you ever experienced God’s Word as a mirror showing you what you truly look like? If so, describe that experience.9. Why is it essential to do something in response to what the Word shows us about ourselves, and not just forget about it?10. See the Study Note on the “perfect law that gives freedom” (v. 25). How can doing what this perfect law says result in freedom and blessing?11. What do you think it means to look intently into this law? 13]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="13">
        <text><![CDATA[DEEPENING12. What examples of obeying this perfect law does James give in verses 19–21 and 26–27?Why do you think these are important issues for us to deal with in our own lives?Read James 2:14–26.13. What does James say about faith and action (or deeds) in verses 14–17?14. Paul tells us that doing right actions doesn’t earn our accep- tance from God (Rom. 4:4–5). Acceptance from God is a free gift based on faith in Jesus Christ. What’s the di erence be- tween doing what God says in order to earn his acceptance and doing what God says as an expression of genuine faith in him?15. James explains the relationship of faith to action using two examples (vv. 15–19). How do these examples demonstrate that “faith” that doesn’t produce right action isn’t genuine saving faith?16. Abraham demonstrated his faith by obeying God’s command to o er up his son (James 2:20–23; Gen. 22). Rahab demonstrated her faith by risking her life to help the Israelites (James 2:25; Joshua 2). How might God want you to demonstrate your faith through action?Genuine faith in Christ must be accompanied by a way of life that does what Christ says. James’s readers, scattered as they are and facing di cult times and complicated relationships, need to under- stand this foundational truth about following Christ. “Faith” that is merely an intellectual assent to some ideas about Christ—that kind of “faith” is dead.14]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[DEVELOPING10 min.Overview: Faith That WorksKingdom-minded people who change the world do so through special gifts God has given us to use as the Holy Spirit leads. The  rst step in developing the gifts that God has given each of us is to deepen our relationship with him through prayer, re ection, and medita- tion on his Word.17. Developing our ability to serve God as the Holy Spirit leads requires that we make time to let God speak to us daily. Which of the following next steps toward this goal are you willing to take for the next few weeks?t Prayer. Commit to connecting with God daily through per- sonal prayer. It’s important to separate yourself from the distractions in your life so you can really focus on commu- nicating with God. Some people  nd it helpful to write out their prayers in a journal.t Re ection. At the end of each session you’ll  nd Re ections Scriptures that speci cally relate to the topic of our study for the session. These are provided to give you an opportunity for reading a short Bible passage  ve days a week during the course of this study. Write down your insights on what you read each day in the space provided. On the sixth day, summarize what God has shown you throughout the week.t Meditation. Psalm 119:11 says: “I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.” Meditation is focused attention on the Word of God and is a great way to internalize God’s Word more deeply. One way to do this is to write a portion of Scripture on a card and tape it somewhere where you’re sure to see it often, such as your bathroom mirror, car’s dashboard, or the kitchen table. Think about it as you get dressed in the morning, when you sit at red lights, or while you’re eating a meal. Re ect on what God is saying to you through his words. Consider using the pas- sages provided in the Re ections pages in each session. As you meditate upon these Scriptures, you will notice them beginning to take up residence in your heart and mind.15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SHARING10 min.DEEPENINGJesus lived and died so that humankind might come to know him and be reconciled to God through him. Through his Holy Spirit, we are empowered to be his witnesses to the people around us.18. Jesus wants all of his disciples to help others connect with him, to know him personally. In the weeks to come, you’ll be asked to identify and share with people in your circle of in uence who need to know Jesus or need to connect with him through a small group community. With this in mind, as you go about your day-to-day activities this week, pay special attention to the people God has placed in your life. There may be co-workers, family or friends, other parents at school or sporting events that you see or talk to on a regular basis. When we meet next time, we’ll talk about how to help connect believers to Chris- tian community and begin sharing Jesus with those who don’t yet know him.SURRENDERING 10 min.Jeremiah 29:13 says, “You will seek me and  nd me when you seek me with all your heart.” God promises to be there for us when we yield our hearts fully to him. Each week you will have a chance to surrender your hearts to God in worship and prayer.19. Consider some di erent ways to worship that might  t your group. Following are a few ideas. Spend a few minutes wor- shiping God together.t Have someone use their musical gifts to lead the group in a worship song. You might sing a simple chorus a cappella, with guitar/piano accompaniment, or with a worship CD.t Read a passage of Scripture aloud together, making it a time of praise and worship as the words remind you of all God has done for you. Choose a psalm or other favorite verses.16]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Overview: Faith That Workst Spend a few minutes praising God aloud. You may highlight some of the attributes of God’s character or praise him for speci c circumstances in your life.20. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. Your time with God is personal and re ects who you are in relationship with him. However you choose to spend your time with him, try to allow time for praise, prayer, and reading of Scripture. Re ections are provided at the end of each session for you to use as part of your daily time with God. These will o er reinforcement of the principles you are learning, and develop or strengthen your habit of time alone with God throughout the week.21. Before you close your group in prayer, answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.Study NotesTwelve tribes scattered among the nations (1:1): The scattered were Jewish Christians, probably from the church in Jerusalem, who were scattered around the Roman Empire after Stephen was stoned and Christ’s followers began to be persecuted (Acts 7:59–8:3; 11:19).Perfect law that gives freedom (1:25): The Word of God. At the time James was writing, the Word of God included the Old Testament and the teachings of Jesus. Jesus had ful lled the sacri cial laws of the Old Testament (making them obsolete) and had given new and deeper interpretation to the Old Testament’s ethical teaching. Faith in Jesus’s sacri ce breaks the bondage of sin and enables obedience to God through the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Living by Jesus’s teaching through the grace of the Spirit gives increasing free-17]]></text>

Hebrews 11 chronicles some “heroes of the faith” whose lives demonstrated “faith in action.” Read each of the following verses and identify the actions that merited being called dem- onstrations of faith.• Abel—“But Abel brought fat portions from some of the  rst- born of his  ock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his o ering” (Gen. 4:4).• Enoch—“When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. And after he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Enoch lived 365 years. Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him away” (Gen. 5:21–24).• Noah—“So God said to Noah, ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is  lled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. Make a roof for it and  nish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. I am going to bring  oodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male18]]></text>

Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.’ Noah did everything just as God commanded him” (Gen. 6:13–22).2. If an addition were to be written to include your life, what would you want it to say? What change do you need to make to ensure that this happens?ReflectionsReading, re ecting, and meditating on the Word of God is essential to getting to know him deeply. As you read the verses each day, give prayerful consideration to what you learn about God, his Spirit, and his place in your life. Then record your thoughts, insights, or prayer in the Re ect section below the verses you read. On the sixth day, record a summary of what you learned over the entire week through this study.Day 1.

A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a few people or for existing groups that lose a few people along the way. Pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another strategy is to ask church leaders to announce that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too small, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months, but every other week can work as well. We recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting, they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch69]]></text>

Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direc- tion, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have some- thing to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will mature and members will share the facilitation of meetings. Healthy groups share hosting and leading. This ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.How do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. Try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can watch the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their young children all evening. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the adults who provide a lesson or care for thechildreneitherinthesamehomeorinanotherhomenearby.This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. Whatever the decision, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.70]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[LEADING FOR THE FIRST TIMELEADERSHIP 101Sweaty palms are a healthy sign. The Bible says God is gracious to the humble. Remember who is in control; the time to worry is when you’re not worried. Those who are soft in heart (and sweaty palmed) are those whom God is sure to speak through.Seek support. Ask your leader, co-leader, or close friend to pray for you and prepare with you before the session. Walking through the study will help you anticipate potentially di cult questions and discussion topics.Bring your uniqueness to the study. Lean into who you are and how God wants you to uniquely lead the study.Prepare. Prepare. Prepare. Go through the session several times. If you are using the DVD, listen to the teaching segment and Leader Lifter. Consider writing in a journal or fasting for a day to prepare yourself for what God wants to do.Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare.Ask for feedback so you can grow. Perhaps in an e-mail or on cards handed out at the study, have everyone write down three things you did well and one thing you could improve on. Don’t get defensive, but show an openness to learn and grow.Prayerfully consider launching a new group. This doesn’t need to happen overnight, but God’s heart is for this to happen over time. Not all Christians are called to be leaders or teachers, but we are all called to be “shepherds” of a few someday.96]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One Overview: Faith That WorksConnecting1. Allow each participant to introduce themselves to the group. Whether your group is new or ongoing, there may be new people in the group who don’t yet have an established relationship with the group. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.As part of this discussion, we recommend talking about shared owner- ship of the group. It’s important that each member have a role. See Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.Also, you will  nd a Small Group Calendar in the Appendix for use in planning your group meetings and roles. Take a look at the calendar prior to your  rst meeting and point it out to the group so that each person can note when and where the group will meet, who will bring snacks, any im- portant upcoming events (birthdays, anniversaries), etc.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.102LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notes4. Jesus’s brothers didn’t believe in him. In Mark 3 they think he’s crazy. In John 7 they know he performs miracles, but they don’t understand the sort of Messiah he is meant to be.5. James saw Jesus after his resurrection. That completely changed James’s attitude.6. Humility is a theme in James’s letter, and James demonstrates it up front. He doesn’t describe himself in ways that  aunt his connections or achieve- ments. His only claim is to be Jesus’s servant. Seeing his brother raised from the dead and understanding how wrong he was has humbled James.7. God’s Word is like a mirror. It shows us who we truly are: what we truly believe, what we truly desire, what we truly do right and wrong. To see what the Word shows us about ourselves—who we are and who we are meant to be—and yet to ignore that, is like forgetting what a mirror tells us about our face.9. If we forget about it, we’re stuck with our sinful habits. We don’t become the person we’re meant to be, and we don’t live the life or do the things we were born for. We call into question whether we really believe in God at all.10. Doing what the Word says gives us freedom from the bondage of sel shness. It gives us the blessing of making a wonderful di erence in others’ lives. It draws us into intimacy with God and makes it possible for us to have deep, sustaining relationships with other people.11. Looking intently involves thinking about what the Word says and means. It involves chewing on the ideas and stories in the Word. It involves taking time to really see what the Word is telling us about ourselves.12. James gives practical examples that deal with how we relate to others. Lis- tening to them. Learning to control our anger and our tongue. Caring for the needy. Avoiding habits that pollute us. James will go on to show that these are not just good deeds but are expressions of genuine faith.13. True saving faith isn’t just intellectual assent to some ideas about God, like “Jesus Christ is God” or “There is only one God, the God of the Bible,” or even “Jesus died for my sins.” True saving faith includes those beliefs but is also trust in Christ that expresses itself in doing what Christ says.14. We don’t obey God in order to earn his acceptance. He fully accepts us because of what Jesus did. We can relax. And we’re so grateful for this acceptance that we respond naturally, not fearfully, with the desire to serve this generous God in whatever ways we can.15. Even demons agree intellectually with ideas like “There is only one God.” They believe these ideas, but they don’t trust. They don’t swear allegiance. They have intellectual “faith” but not trust-faith. And saying loving things103]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesto a needy person without doing loving things for them isn’t love. It’s just words. Likewise, saying loving things to God without doing loving things for him is also just words, not real love-faith.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.17. The intent of this question is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes a life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to see the importance of making time to connect with God a priority in their life. Encourage everyone to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.18. Encourage the group to observe their interactions during the coming week with the intention of using these observations next week in evaluating the people that God has placed in their lives that he might want them to share with or invite to small group.SurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each session will pro- vide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.104]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notes20. Encourage group members to use the Re ections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while rein- forcing the lesson of this session through related Scripture.21. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept con dent if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in most ses- sions. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study, consider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.Session Two Wisdom through TrialsGrowing3. We should do so because trials lead to desirable things like perseverance and maturity.4. If we’re honest, many of us will acknowledge that rejoicing in trials is tough. For many of us, the trouble is that we value things like comfort, security, or people’s approval more than perseverance and maturity. When trials deprive of us of things we want more than we want maturity, then of course we don’t respond with joy. But one of the bene ts of trials is that they help us see what we value more than the things God values.5. James shares Jesus’s view that being humbled is, on a spiritual level, being truly exalted. He also says that life is so short that material possessions aren’t that big a deal from an eternal perspective. These are extremely hard attitudes for many of us in our materialistic and status-seeking society to hold onto.6. Without such persistence, we’ll be paralyzed, unable to do what God put us on earth to do; we’ll be discouraged and miserable; and we’ll sadden God with our stubborn immaturity.7. Wisdom enables us to make God-oriented decisions about how to respond to trials. A wise person understands how life works, so a wise person values perseverance and maturity more than comfort and security.105]]></text>
