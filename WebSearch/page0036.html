<noscript> Leader’s Notes4. Jesus’s brothers didn’t believe in him. In Mark 3 they think he’s crazy. In John 7 they know he performs miracles, but they don’t understand the sort of Messiah he is meant to be.5. James saw Jesus after his resurrection. That completely changed James’s attitude.6. Humility is a theme in James’s letter, and James demonstrates it up front. He doesn’t describe himself in ways that  aunt his connections or achieve- ments. His only claim is to be Jesus’s servant. Seeing his brother raised from the dead and understanding how wrong he was has humbled James.7. God’s Word is like a mirror. It shows us who we truly are: what we truly believe, what we truly desire, what we truly do right and wrong. To see what the Word shows us about ourselves—who we are and who we are meant to be—and yet to ignore that, is like forgetting what a mirror tells us about our face.9. If we forget about it, we’re stuck with our sinful habits. We don’t become the person we’re meant to be, and we don’t live the life or do the things we were born for. We call into question whether we really believe in God at all.10. Doing what the Word says gives us freedom from the bondage of sel shness. It gives us the blessing of making a wonderful di erence in others’ lives. It draws us into intimacy with God and makes it possible for us to have deep, sustaining relationships with other people.11. Looking intently involves thinking about what the Word says and means. It involves chewing on the ideas and stories in the Word. It involves taking time to really see what the Word is telling us about ourselves.12. James gives practical examples that deal with how we relate to others. Lis- tening to them. Learning to control our anger and our tongue. Caring for the needy. Avoiding habits that pollute us. James will go on to show that these are not just good deeds but are expressions of genuine faith.13. True saving faith isn’t just intellectual assent to some ideas about God, like “Jesus Christ is God” or “There is only one God, the God of the Bible,” or even “Jesus died for my sins.” True saving faith includes those beliefs but is also trust in Christ that expresses itself in doing what Christ says.14. We don’t obey God in order to earn his acceptance. He fully accepts us because of what Jesus did. We can relax. And we’re so grateful for this acceptance that we respond naturally, not fearfully, with the desire to serve this generous God in whatever ways we can.15. Even demons agree intellectually with ideas like “There is only one God.” They believe these ideas, but they don’t trust. They don’t swear allegiance. They have intellectual “faith” but not trust-faith. And saying loving things103 </noscript>
